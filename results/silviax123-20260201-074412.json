The Setup**\n*   **Buy 1 ATM Call**: Strike $180\n*   **Buy 1 ATM Put**: Strike $180\n*   **Expiration**: The nearest weekly expiration that captures the earnings report (approx. 5-7 days out).\n*   **Net Cost (Debit)**: **$14.00** ($1,400 per contract)\n\n#### **2.

          "predicted": "To: Administrative Services Staff\nFrom: Administrative Services Manager\nDate: July 16, 2025\nSubject: Tentative Cleanup Schedule for Blight Remediation\n\nAs you are aware, our community has experienced a steady population decrease over the last decade, leading to increased concerns regarding blight and debris. To address this, General Services has assigned dedicated crews to clean up debris, and we have received interest from volunteers wishing to assist with light trash pickup in specific areas.\n\nTo facilitate this collaboration and ensure a coordinated effort, a tentative cleanup schedule has been prepared. This schedule outlines when crews will be working in specific regions (Sections 1-4) of the city.\n\n**Purpose of the Schedule**\nHistorically, cleanup efforts have been hampered by understaffing and the lack of a formal process. Requests were often handled ad-hoc, leading to unfinished jobs and dissatisfied residents when crews were diverted to other emergencies. The goal of this new set/rotating schedule is to ensure a concentrated effort in specific areas each week. By adhering to this plan, we aim to progressively reduce the amount of debris in each section, making maintenance more manageable over time.\n\n**Handling Schedule Disruptions**\nPlease inform volunteers that this schedule is tentative. Crews may face disruptions due to emergencies or severe weather (particularly during the snow season starting in November). In such cases:\n*   Crews may temporarily shift to another area to address immediate hazards.\n*   Once the emergency is resolved, crews will return to the original location to complete the scheduled work or reschedule the missed area as appropriate.\n*   Administrative staff should advise callers that dates are estimates and subject to change.\n\n**Customer Service**\nThis schedule is also a tool to enhance our customer service. When residents call to report illegal dumping or debris, you can now provide them with an estimated timeframe for abatement based on their section.\n\nAttached to this memo is a PDF of the tentative schedule and an Excel version for your reference. Please use these documents to coordinate with volunteers and answer public inquiries.\n\nThank you for your cooperation in helping us eliminate blight and improve our community.\n\n***\n\n**[Excel Schedule Content]**\n\n| Section | Date Range | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Section 1 | April 1 \u2013 April 4, 2025 | |\n| Section 1 | April 7 \u2013 April 11, 2025 | |\n| Section 2 | April 14 \u2013 April 18, 2025 | |\n| Section 3 | April 21 \u2013 April 25, 2025 | |\n| Section 4 | April 28 \u2013 May 2, 2025 | |\n| Section 1 | May 5 \u2013 May 9, 2025 | |\n| Section 2 | May 12 \u2013 May 16, 2025 | |\n| Section 3 | May 19 \u2013 May 23, 2025 | |\n| Section 4 | May 27 \u2013 May 30, 2025 | |\n| Section 1 | June 2 \u2013 June 6, 2025 | |\n| Section 2 | June 9 \u2013 June 13, 2025 | |\n| Section 3 | June 16 \u2013 June 20, 2025 | |\n| Section 4 | June 23 \u2013 June 27, 2025 | |\n| Section 1 | June 30 \u2013 July 3, 2025 | |\n| Section 2 | July 7 \u2013 July 11, 2025 | |\n| Section 3 | July 14 \u2013 July 18, 2025 | |\n| Section 4 | July 21 \u2013 July 25, 2025 | |\n| Section 1 | July 28 \u2013 August 1, 2025 | |\n| Section 2 | August 4 \u2013 August 8, 2025 | |\n| Section 3 | August 11 \u2013 August 15, 2025 | |\n| Section 4 | August 18 \u2013 August 22, 2025 | |\n| Section 1 | August 25 \u2013 August 29, 2025 | |\n| Section 2 | Sept 2 \u2013 Sept 5, 2025 | |\n| Section 3 | Sept 8 \u2013 Sept 12, 2025 | |\n| Section 4 | Sept 15 \u2013 Sept 19, 2025 | |\n| Section 1 | Sept 22 \u2013 Sept 26, 2025 | |\n| Section 2 | Sept 29 \u2013 Oct 3, 2025 | |\n| Section 3 | Oct 6 \u2013 Oct 10, 2025 | |\n| Section 4 | Oct 13 \u2013 Oct 17, 2025 | |\n| Section 1 | Oct 20 \u2013 Oct 24, 2025 | |\n| Section 2 | Oct 27 \u2013 Oct 31, 2025 | |\n| Section 3 | Nov 3 \u2013 Nov 7, 2025 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 4 | Nov 10 \u2013 Nov 14, 2025 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 1 | Nov 17 \u2013 Nov 21, 2025 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 2 | Nov 24 \u2013 Dec 5, 2025 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 3 | Dec 8 \u2013 Dec 12, 2025 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 4 | Dec 15 \u2013 Dec 19, 2025 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 1 | Dec 22 \u2013 Jan 2, 2026 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 2 | Jan 5 \u2013 Jan 9, 2026 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 3 | Jan 12 \u2013 Jan 16, 2026 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 4 | Jan 20 \u2013 Jan 23, 2026 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 1 | Jan 26 \u2013 Jan 30, 2026 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 2 | Feb 2 \u2013 Feb 6, 2026 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 3 | Feb 9 \u2013 Feb 13, 2026 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 4 | Feb 16 \u2013 Feb 20, 2026 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 1 | Feb 23 \u2013 Feb 27, 2026 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 2 | March 2 \u2013 March 6, 2026 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 3 | March 9 \u2013 March 13, 2026 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 4 | March 16 \u2013 March 20, 2026 | Tentative (Snow Season) |\n| Section 1 | March 23 \u2013 March 27, 2026 | Winter Season Ends |\n| Section 2 | March 30 \u2013 March 31, 2026 | |To: Administrative Services Staff\nFrom: Administrative Services Manager\nDate: July 16, 2025\nSubject: Tentative Cleanup Schedule for Blight Remediation\n\nAs you are aware, our community has experienced a steady population decrease over the last decade, leading to increased concerns regarding blight and debris.
