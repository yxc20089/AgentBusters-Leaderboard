This involves buying both a call and a put option at the same strike price and expiration date. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Buy 1 Call Option** at the $180 strike price.\n2. **Buy 1 Put Option** at the $180 strike price.\n3. Both options should have the same expiration date, ideally the nearest one after the earnings report.\n\n### Cost and Breakeven Points\n\n- **Total Cost**: $14 (as given for the ATM straddle)\n- **Breakeven Points**:\n  - **Upside**: $180 + $14 = $194\n  - **Downside**: $180 - $14 = $166\n\n### Profit Scenarios\n\n- **Profit if the stock moves above $194** or below $166 by expiration.\n- **Loss is limited to the total premium paid ($14)** if the stock price remains between $166 and $194.\n\nThis strategy profits from significant volatility in either direction, which aligns with your expectation of an 8% move post-earnings.

This initiative aims to address the challenges we have historically faced due to understaffing and the absence of a formal process. The new schedule will allow for a concentrated effort in specific areas each week, ensuring that our cleanup crews can better address community concerns at a scheduled time.\n\n**Schedule Overview:**\n\nAttached to this memo, you will find the tentative schedule in both PDF and Excel formats. This schedule outlines when our General Services employees, along with volunteers, will be working in specific regions of the city. The goal is to maintain a set/rotating schedule to systematically reduce blight and minimize debris over time.\n\n**Volunteer Coordination:**\n\nVolunteers have expressed a desire to assist our crews by picking up light trash and debris. Administrative staff are requested to inform volunteers of the schedule when they call the office. The attached Excel version of the schedule is designed to be a clear and accessible format for reference and sharing with volunteers.\n\n**Handling Schedule Disruptions:**\n\nIn the event of emergencies or severe weather, crews may need to temporarily shift to another area. In such cases, the following protocol will be followed:\n\n1. **Immediate Response:** Crews will address the emergency or severe weather situation as a priority.\n2. **Rescheduling:** Once the situation is resolved, crews will return to the original location or reschedule missed areas as appropriate.\n3. **Communication:** Administrative staff will be informed of any changes to the schedule, and volunteers will be updated accordingly.\n\n**Enhancing Customer Service:**\n\nThe new schedule will enhance our customer service capabilities. Administrative staff will now be able to provide residents with an estimated timeline for debris abatement when they call to report complaints about debris or illegal dumping. This proactive approach is expected to improve resident satisfaction and community relations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation and support in implementing this new schedule. By working together, we can make significant strides in improving the cleanliness and appearance of our community. Please review the attached schedule and be prepared to assist volunteers and residents with any inquiries.\n\nThank you for your dedication to our community's well-being.\n\n**Attachments:**  \n1.

Administrative staff are requested to inform volunteers of the schedule when they call the office. The attached Excel version of the schedule is designed to be a clear and accessible format for reference and sharing with volunteers.\n\n**Handling Schedule Disruptions:**\n\nIn the event of emergencies or severe weather, crews may need to temporarily shift to another area. In such cases, the following protocol will be followed:\n\n1. **Immediate Response:** Crews will address the emergency or severe weather situation as a priority.\n2. **Rescheduling:** Once the situation is resolved, crews will return to the original location or reschedule missed areas as appropriate.\n3. **Communication:** Administrative staff will be informed of any changes to the schedule, and volunteers will be updated accordingly.\n\n**Enhancing Customer Service:**\n\nThe new schedule will enhance our customer service capabilities. Administrative staff will now be able to provide residents with an estimated timeline for debris abatement when they call to report complaints about debris or illegal dumping. This proactive approach is expected to improve resident satisfaction and community relations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation and support in implementing this new schedule. By working together, we can make significant strides in improving the cleanliness and appearance of our community. Please review the attached schedule and be prepared to assist volunteers and residents with any inquiries.\n\nThank you for your dedication to our community's well-being.\n\n**Attachments:**  \n1.
