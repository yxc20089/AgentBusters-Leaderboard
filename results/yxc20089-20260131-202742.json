However, I can still guide you on how to set up a strategy based on the information you provided.\n\n### Strategy: Long Straddle\n\nGiven your expectation of a significant move in Amazon's stock price post-earnings, a **Long Straddle** is a suitable strategy. This involves buying both a call and a put option at the same strike price and expiration date. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Buy 1 Call Option** at the $180 strike price.\n2. **Buy 1 Put Option** at the $180 strike price.\n3. **Expiration Date**: Use the nearest expiration date post-earnings.\n\n### Cost and Breakeven Points\n\n- **Total Cost**: $14 (as given for the ATM straddle)\n- **Breakeven Points**:\n  - **Upside**: $180 + $14 = $194\n  - **Downside**: $180 - $14 = $166\n\n### Profit Potential\n\n- **Profit**: If the stock moves significantly above $194 or below $166, you will profit from the strategy.\n- **Loss**: The maximum loss is limited to the total premium paid ($14) if the stock price remains at $180 at expiration.\n\nThis strategy benefits from high volatility, as you expect a move greater than the average 8% post-earnings. If the stock moves significantly in either direction, the gains from one of the options will offset the cost of both, leading to a profit.\n\nIf you need further assistance or specific data, please let me know!",
