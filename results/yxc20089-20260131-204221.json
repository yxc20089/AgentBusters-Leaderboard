However, I can still guide you on how to set up a strategy based on the information provided.\n\n### Strategy: Long Straddle\n\nGiven your expectation of a significant move in Amazon's stock price post-earnings, a **long straddle** is an appropriate strategy. This involves buying both a call and a put option at the same strike price and expiration date. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Buy 1 Call Option** at the $180 strike price.\n2. **Buy 1 Put Option** at the $180 strike price.\n3. Both options should have the same expiration date, ideally the nearest one post-earnings.\n\n### Cost and Breakeven Points\n\n- **Total Cost**: $14 (as given for the ATM straddle)\n- **Breakeven Points**:\n  - **Upside**: $180 + $14 = $194\n  - **Downside**: $180 - $14 = $166\n\n### Profit Potential\n\n- **Profit if the stock moves above $194** or below $166 by expiration.\n- The profit is theoretically unlimited on the upside and substantial on the downside, depending on how far the stock moves.\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Volatility**: The strategy profits from high volatility. If the actual move is less than expected, the strategy may incur a loss.\n- **Time Decay**: As expiration approaches, the time value of the options decreases, which can impact profitability if the stock doesn't move significantly.\n\nThis strategy is designed to capitalize on the expected 8% move, which translates to approximately $14.40 in either direction from the current price of $180.

This involves buying both a call and a put option at the same strike price and expiration date. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Buy 1 Call Option** at the $180 strike price.\n2. **Buy 1 Put Option** at the $180 strike price.\n3. Both options should have the same expiration date, ideally the nearest one post-earnings.\n\n### Cost and Breakeven Points\n\n- **Total Cost**: $14 (as given for the ATM straddle)\n- **Breakeven Points**:\n  - **Upside**: $180 + $14 = $194\n  - **Downside**: $180 - $14 = $166\n\n### Profit Potential\n\n- **Profit if the stock moves above $194** or below $166 by expiration.\n- The profit is theoretically unlimited on the upside and substantial on the downside, depending on how far the stock moves.\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Volatility**: The strategy profits from high volatility. If the actual move is less than expected, the strategy may incur a loss.\n- **Time Decay**: As expiration approaches, the time value of the options decreases, which can impact profitability if the stock doesn't move significantly.\n\nThis strategy is designed to capitalize on the expected 8% move, which translates to approximately $14.40 in either direction from the current price of $180.
